        <p>The UN sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG) “Affordable and Clean Energy” is expected to be achieved by 2030.  This goal aims to i) ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, ii) substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and iii) double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. In addition to its direct impact on improving livelihoods, access to modern, sustainable energy services is often regarded as a necessity for achieving all of  the other SDGs.

        <p>According to the United Nations, 700 million people (10% of the world’s population) still live in poverty. A shocking statistic by any account, but one that many of us forget as we get on with our busy lives and deal with our own personal stresses.

          What is less well known, or less discussed, is that people living in poverty need access to energy far more than their more affluent peers – to keep warm, to provide and prepare healthy food, and to access clean water. Click on the headline to read more.</p>

        <p>Hot on the heels of COVID-19, the world faces more turmoil. This year, Davos 2022 aptly focused on the tragic war in Ukraine and its ripple effect on global finance, food, and energy systems. The current state of the world reminds us to what degree energy underpins our aspirations for a more sustainable future for all - and how broken the global energy system is.

        <p>Europe is meeting a growing share of its energy needs through renewable sources but is also still dependent on oil and gas. With rapidly changing energy prices, concerns over keeping homes warm this winter and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is a need to save energy, diversify its sources, accelerate the shift to renewables and support those who are most vulnerable.
